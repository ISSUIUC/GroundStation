Additional Information:

- To view the log files generated by the program
       * On Windows, in file explorer, go to: ```Users\your_username\appData\logs\ISS-Ground-Station```

[^1]: In the past we have had issues where not all packages install on the first go. Thus, it is recommended to run this at least twice.
[^2]: Ensure that the ```Satellite/``` and ```Terrain/``` FOLDER contains subfolders ```1/``` to ```18/``` and not another folder called Satellite/Terrain. If this happens move the inner folder into the build/ folder instead.
